This is a mechatronics assignment developed by me in Semester-7. 
It is an autonomous guided vehicle with object avoidance protocols (powered by HCSR05 Ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor), all libraries used have been marked in the code.
The IR sensors used will need periodical recalibration to sense the black line which the AGV follows.
Please make sure that the black line which the AGV follows does not have any debris, dirt or objects which may come in between the IR sensors and the line and cause stoppage of AGV.
